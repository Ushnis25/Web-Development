# ONLINE BANKING SYSTEM

This PHP project focuses on developing an online banking system where the customer in order to be a part of the system must register into it. Also, the user can then make payments effortlessly, transfer funds to all the registered accounts in the system, view his/her account details and the summary in the 'Accounts' section.
Also, there is an Admin section where the Admin can manage the users, employees using the system.
